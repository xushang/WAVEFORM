BUGS
----
[] Investigate and solve Curt's mysterious opMatrix overhead.
[] oppWindow class inheritance needs to be fixed (or moved).


FEATURES
--------
[] Organize and condense all operator-specific tests into their respective xtratests function.
[] Change spottests to grab all available spot operator in the path and run their unit tests (utest).
[] Do something about the general general tests which dont apply to one specific operator.
[] Write unit tests for opHaar, and a whole bunch of other testless spot operators.

DOCUMENTATION
-------------

[] Note that the random operators depend on old-style calls to
randn('state'). These are not compatible with the latest stream-based
calls. Need to document this.
